    <p>Though i dont normally play the fanboy or die in the hill of defending 
        "The best programming languaje" or the "Blazingierer fasterer" like JS framework 
        developers say, in part from my not so deep technical knowledge of the intricacies of 
        the many languages out there, but what i can say for sure, in my experience SBCL 
        (Steel bank common lisp) is the best one for backend development, and fir frontend,
        the best interfaces can be made with the godot engine, SBCL gives robustness, security 
        ,memory safety and high performance for the backend, a repl, and extremely fast recompile speeds
        while godot provides an intuitive way to drag and drop UI items, and i think it 
        should be given a chance in reactive applications development</p>
